Introducing the Wormhole Waffles, a recipe that bends spacetime itself, 
combining nonsense measurements and scientific jargon to create a breakfast 
adventure beyond the boundaries of our universe. Prepare to embark on a 
culinary journey through the cosmos.

Ingredients:

1 event horizon of Triticum aestivum (all-purpose flour)
3 cosmic strings of Ovum (eggs)
5 x 10^8 nanoseconds of Lactose (milk)
1 parsec of Hydrogenated oil (vegetable oil)
1.21 gigawatts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baking powder)
1 neutrino of Sodium Chloride (salt)
6 parsecs of Vanilla Planifolia (vanilla extract)
2 pulsars of Saccharum (sugar)
Instructions:

Step 1: Measure 1 event horizon of all-purpose flour by using the gravitational 
radius of a black hole as a reference. Ensure that the flour does not collapse 
into a singularity.

Step 2: Unravel 3 cosmic strings of eggs from the fabric of spacetime, and harness 
the energy of the cosmic strings to blend the eggs into a smooth and uniform consistency.

Step 3: Utilize a time dilation chamber to extract 5 x 10^8 nanoseconds of milk. 
Be cautious not to age the milk beyond its expiration date.

Step 4: Stretch 1 parsec of vegetable oil across the cosmic horizon, and then fold 
it back upon itself using gravitational waves. Be mindful of potential wormholes 
forming in the process.

Step 5: Acquire 1.21 gigawatts of baking powder by converting the energy output 
of a lightning bolt into a leavening agent.

Step 6: Borrow a single neutrino of salt from a nearby supernova explosion, 
making sure not to alter the delicate balance of the cosmos.

Step 7: Measure 6 parsecs of vanilla extract by using a celestial measuring cup, 
ensuring that its aroma transcends the boundaries of the known universe.

Step 8: Capture the energy of 2 pulsars and crystallize it into sugar, being 
cautious not to create any gamma-ray bursts in your kitchen.

Step 9: Combine all the ingredients in a tesseract mixing bowl, initiate a 
four-dimensional blend to merge everything into a smooth and homogeneous Wormhole Waffle batter.

Step 10: Preheat a waffle iron to the surface temperature of the Sun 
(approximately 5,505Â°C). Use a thermal shield to protect yourself and your kitchen.

Step 11: Pour the Wormhole Waffle batter into the preheated waffle iron and 
cook until golden brown, being cautious of potential time loops or spatial anomalies.

Your Wormhole Waffles are now complete! Enjoy the extraordinary taste of these 
scientifically crafted waffles, and be prepared for potential interdimensional travel 
as you savor each bite. Don't forget to top them with your favorite syrup, fruit, or 
whipped cream from across the galaxy!
